# BNF Partenariats
In the context of the Telecom Paristech course *ETIC 2016*, and together with 
- Amale el Hamri
- Alexandre Philbert
- Pierre-Marie Ageneau
- Astrid St-Martin

I designed a [website](http://ethique-tic.fr/2016/projets/projets-bnfpartenariats/index.html) (my first one) which is aimed at showing all the aspects of a controversial project : the partnership between private companies (namely Google, and Apple among others) with the French gouvernment in an attempt to digitalize many pieces of litterature of colossal importance to French legacy.

Our work included the collection and selection of informations, the user experience (surfing path and questionning), the webdesign and architecture of the website. I was in charge of this last part.
